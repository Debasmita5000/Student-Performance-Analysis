# Student-Performance-Analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Student Performance Analysis Using Python
I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project where I explored factors affecting student performance. ðŸ“Š

âœ… What I Did:
1. Analyzed demographic and academic data (gender, ethnicity, parental education).
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, Pandas, Seaborn.
3. Visualized insights with bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, and heatmaps.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings:
âœ… Students with highly educated parents perform significantly better.
âœ… Sports practice boosts student performance and promotes balance.
âœ… Gender differences highlight the need for custom learning strategies.

ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:
1. Engage parents in academic programs.
2. Offer tailored learning based on gender trends.
3. Encourage sports and extracurricular activities for overall development.

ðŸ’¡ Tools & Techniques:
 Python, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization

This project sharpened my skills in Python, data visualization, and storytelling through data!
